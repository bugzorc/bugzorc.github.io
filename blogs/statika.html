    <h1>BUGZORC.GITHUG.IO BLOG SYSTEM MANUAL [STATIKA]</h1>
    </center>
    <h3>Why I use my custom blog system</h3>
    <p>
      When using github pages we can't code in any server running language or framework, which makes one to be very limited. 
      I have seen many other ways to generate blogs like jenkyll, though I love it am dreadfully in love with 
      this site's theme plus am not gonna waste time modify jenkyll's source code to generate stuff like code snippets.
      Markdown? Oh, I'd check on <a href="https://github.com/markedjs/marked" target="_blank">marked library</a>, tho I was about 
      to reach my goal, it does all the feature that suites plus it doesn't have alot of features... I give it the name STATIKA, 
      as in good for static pages.
    </p>
    <h3>How pages are generated</h3>
    <p>
      A javascript file reads the url which is like <span class="block">example.com/blog.html?file=statika.html</span>
      copies the html from the file named blog.html from the blogs folder, it into the div with the class <span class="block">blogContent</span>, 
      then it's automatically rendered by the browser, css to modify the blog is in blog.css. 
      <br><br>
      TIP:to write blogs fast, use VSCODE or any IDE that generates html with shortcuts, of example if I want to add
      <span class="block">&lt;span class=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>, I would just type <span class="block">span.block.</span> 
      then press <span class="block">Enter</span>.
      <br><br>
      Statika also comes a with print button, which gets content from the div with the ClassName blogContent. Source code for the print 
      button is in print.js, you can make anything clickable just add <span class="block">onclick="printBlog()"</span>, also make source
      to include the src path in ur header.
    </p>
    <h3>Let's test some stuff&#128568;</h3>
    <p>
      How about an old image:
      <br>
      <img src="images/staticImages/xp.jpeg" alt="Image unavailable" class="blogImage">
      <br>
      How about code:
      <br>
    <div class="snippet">
      <pre>
<code class="code">
function greet() {
console.log('Hello, World!'); 
}</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      How about a long ahh code:
    </p>
    <div class="snippet">
      <pre>
<code class="code">
function greet() {
console.log('Hello, World!');  ajgajsgljgdjewio egiajgajsgljgdjewio egiajgajsgljgdjewio egiajgajsgljgdjewio egiajgajsgljgdjewio egiajgajsgljgdjewio egiajgajsgljgdjewio egiajgajsgljgdjewio egi
}</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      What about line-based tokenization:
      <br>
      life is good, but it can be better
      <br>
      <span class="lbt">life is good, but it can be better</span>
      <br><br>
      What about tabs:
      <br>
      <span class="tab">tab be workin' all day</span>
      <br><br>
      I think that's all
