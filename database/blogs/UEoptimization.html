    <h1>UNREAL ENGINE OPTIMIZATION SERIES INDEX</h1>
</center>

<p>
Unreal Engine ruining games, unreal engine is pathetic, unreal engine is unoptimized, 
unreal engine this, unreal engine that. Don't blame the engine, blame the beholder, 
for developers bashing on the engine, remember, "<span class="red">A bad craftsman blames 
his tools.</span>" and for the gamers "<span class="red">Blame the chef, not the kitchen</span>." 
Some people have already stopped reading the blog&#128569;.</p>

<p>
In this blog/video series which will have 3s easons or possibly more, we will start with the basics and move on to more advanced topics later on. Wait! Before diving in, here is a key optimization advice.  
<br>
"<span class="red">Remember, imports from other software should also be optimized. What do I mean by that? If you import a rig from Blender, make sure it is optimized, has good topology, and so on.</span>"
<br>
In this series, what you choose to import is up to you, we will focus solely on Unreal Engine, but you can check out my blender blogs on optimizations, and for maya and other 3d programs... no comment... Anyways, let's index tittles of season 1.
</p>

<h3>Profile your game [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Before you start optimizing, it is important to understand where our game's performance bottleneck are. Use the built-in profiling tools in Unreal Engine to I identify which parts of you games are causing much usage on your CPU and GPU.
</p>

<h3>Optimize Your Assets [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    High-quality assets can add a lot to your game's visuals, but they can also slow down performance. Use Unreal Engine's LOD system to reduce the number of polygons in your assets when they're far away from the player, and use textures with lower resolutions to reduce the GPU load.
</p>

<h3>Use Level Streaming [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Level streaming is a technique that allows you to divide your game world into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can help reduce the amount of memory your game needs to load and can improve performance by only loading the necessary parts of the game world at any given time.
</p>

<h3>Use Culling Techniques [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Culling is a technique that prevents objects that are not visible from being rendered, which can help reduce the number of draw calls and improve performance. Use techniques like occlusion culling, frustum culling, and distance culling to optimize your game's performance.
</p>

<h3>Use Post-Process Effects Sparingly [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Post-process effects like bloom, motion blur, and depth of field can add a lot to your game's visuals, but they can also impact performance. Use them sparingly and only when necessary to avoid hurting your game's performance.
</p>

<h3>Optimize Your Lighting [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Lighting can have a significant impact on your game's performance. Use static lighting whenever possible, and use lightmaps to reduce the number of dynamic lights in your scene. You can also use light baking to precompute lighting and reduce the amount of real-time lighting needed.
</p>

<h3>Use Static Meshes for Simple Objects [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Finally, make sure to test your game on different hardware configurations to ensure that it runs smoothly on a variety of machines. Use the scalability settings in Unreal Engine to adjust your game's graphics settings automatically based on the user's hardware.
</p>

<h3>Use Blueprints Efficiently [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Blueprints can be a powerful tool in Unreal Engine, but they can also slow down performance if not used efficiently. Back inna days we used to use  blueprint nativization, but it was removed.. <span class="blue"><a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-5-migration-guide?application_version=5.0">Unreal Engine 5 Migration guide</a>. This is actually gonna be the shortest video of the series.</span>
</p>

<h3>Use LODs for Particle Effects [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Particle effects can be taxing on your GPU, especially when there are many of them on screen at once. Use LODs to reduce the number of particles that are rendered when they're far away from the player.
</p>

<h3>Test Your Game on Different Hardware [Coming Soon]</h3>
<p>
    Finally, make sure to test your game on different hardware configurations to ensure that it runs smoothly on a variety of machines. Use the scalability settings in Unreal Engine to adjust your game's graphics settings automatically based on the user's hardware.
